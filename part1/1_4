$ docker run -it --name looper ubuntu:latest sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'
# paralelly opened another terminal and ran:
$ docker exec -it looper bash
$ apt update && apt install curl
# switched back to previous terminal and entered helsinki.fi
# got the desired response
# perhaps other smart solutions would be to create some kind of pipe for curl

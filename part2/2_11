# I did something very similar to the node example, added Dockerfile and docker-compose
# I did this to the "full stack open" project of mine where 
# npm(node package manager) did almost everything for me
# everything worked in real-time with docker-compose up command
# some content of the specific lines had to be changed compared to the material example
# the application resides on heroku: https://maamme.herokuapp.com
